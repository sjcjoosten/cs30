# Thank you for contributing!

The CS30 project is a small project. If you are here to contribute, you probably know Sebastiaan, and you can email him directly with any questions on how to contribute, or any other question.

If you don't know who Sebastiaan is, or you do but you don't have his email address, then this project has become larger than anticipated when this CONTRIBUTING file was written, that's great news!
Please create an issue in the issue tracker and let us know what you expected to learn from reading this file, and we'll put some instructions and recommendations in place.
In the mean time, if you have any code changes that would benefit this project, please create a pull request and make sure your name is in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
