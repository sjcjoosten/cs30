-- | A list of files that will be statically linked to the executable by inlining them.
-- This means files are kept in memory while the program runs, giving a blazingly fast way of serving them.
-- The files in this list are currently a couple of megabytes large collectively,
-- if more files are needed, it is perhaps better to dynamically link them instead.
-- The code in 'Static.hs' is responsible for the static linking.
